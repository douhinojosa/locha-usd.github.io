### Why pegged to USD _index price_ and not USD as collateral?
A collateralized digital asset could be designed using the following types of collateral;

|Type            |Collateral|
|--------|--------|
|Money           |dollar, euro, yen, ..       |
|Commodities     |oil, gold, corn, ..         |
|Securities      |stocks, banknotes, bonds, ..|
|Cryptocurrencies|bitcoin, ethereum, ..       |

or be designed by a mixed formula, LUSD uses USDT as collateral to reduce research/development friction, although USDT is collateralized in USD we cannot and should not attest to this statement, for more information about [USDT visit their website](https://tether.to/)

### Why not use USDT directly?
