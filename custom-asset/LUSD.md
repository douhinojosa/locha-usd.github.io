# LUSD an asset pegged to USD [_index price_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index)  


### Why pegged to USD _index price_ and not USD as collateral?

***
A collateralized digital asset could be designed using the following types of collateral;

|Type       |Collateral|
|--------|--------|
|Money      |dollar, euro, yen, ..      |
|Commodities|oil, gold, corn, ..        |
|Securities |stocks, banknotes, bonds,..|

or be designed by a mixed formula, LUSD uses USDT as collateral to reduce research/development friction, although USDT is collateralized in USD we cannot and should not attest to this statement, for more information about [USDT visit their website](https://tether.to/)


### Why not use USDT directly?
